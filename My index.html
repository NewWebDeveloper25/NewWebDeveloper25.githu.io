    <section>
    <P>When I first started toward learning a field in It i will be honest I didn't know what to pick at. <br>
    I wanted to know for sure what I wanted to go for before I made my final decision. <br> I would spend whole days studying various concepts and learning as much it as possible about <br> almost every field that had to deal with IT.</P>
    <h2>My Top 3 Careers</h2>
    <h3>Web Developler</h3>
    <p>The first Career I looked into was Web Developler. <br>I first got interested in this because of the various site layouts I would come accross while surfing <br> the web and a good bit of that came about when I first made a MySpace account. 
    I always liked <br> how Myspace would allow you to modify your very own webpage. They allowed you to not only <br> change the background but also to apply music and or play videos in the background. It allowed a <br> lot of people to make a webpage that was basically them on a website.</p>
   <h3>Cyber Security Specialist</h3>
   <p>I looked into the Cyber security purely because I was curious about what were the most demanding jobs in IT. <br>
    I found out that most major organizations need Cyber security to be top notch if they want to keep their data <br>
    safe from being hacked and then sold to the highest bidder. So they hire a Cyber security Specialist to deal <br> with kepping not only the company data safe but also keep customer data safe. I would be lying if I did not say <br>
    that the money for job was not very tantalizing to think off to say the least. A bonus or a curse depending how <br> 
    you view it is you wont get bored because every day might be a new challenge to test your skills. </p>
    <h3>Data Analyst</h3>
    <p>I looked into a data Analyst purely for the sole reason I was curious about if analysts worked closely with Web developlers? <br>
    I found out that a Data Analyst really is to organise and analyze data to make sure the information is accurate and reliable. <br>
   I found out they basically help out almost in every possible department you could think of.<br> They can also help Cyber security out by helping them identify what specific systems may or may have not been cmpromised. <br>
    This had me think this particular Career path was sure to have many oppertunities for me to learn and grow my skills in IT. </p>
