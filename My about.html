    <P>When I first started toward learning a field in It i will be honest I didn't know what to pick at first. <br>
    I wanted to know for sure what I wanted to go for before I made my final decision. <br> I would spend whole days studying various concepts and learning as much as possible about <br> almost every field that had to deal with IT.</P>
    <h2>My Top challenges</h2>
       <h3>learning html!</h3>
    <p>Lerning html was difficult for me because it was entirely new skill to me and that i never really tried to mess with html before going to school for a potential career in it. I had to learn how to implement the variouse html code in Visual Studio which is a website that allows you to use html for web developing for beginners. At first it was a bit dificult to get the html code right but after reading and watching various video of other people trying their hand at html I was able to learn from them and apply proper html code. I finally started to use the corect code configurations but I must admit I had trouble imputing the code in the correct order as to not get confused on what goes where.</p>
       <h3>Lerning links/ functions</h3>
   <p>Learning how to add links and functions I must admit was definitly tricky to wrap my head around. I had a frustrating time trying to add functions to the webpages. I was having a hard puting the functions in the proper places. I even sometimes managed to put the function inside the wrong section. The functions were also a bit tricky for me at least to implement various values for the functions. The links on the other hand where not as bad as the rest. Infact I believe the only problems I had with implmenting the various links was that I had to either have it all in the same folder or the link had to be setup in a different manner. </p>
